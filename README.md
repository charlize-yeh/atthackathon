# atthackathon
**inspiration**: we all love wordle and online puzzle games. The morning of the hackathon, we were playing our daily word games and we started to question why we were so addicted to this word games. Why would we be willing to do these games everyday? Therefore, we realized that we needed to create something interactive and engaging that would motivate people to use 5G and fiber more. People like us love small daily games so if we combine the two together, we can encourage people to use AT&T 5G more. Another component of the site is the live network footprint statistics. We love websites where we can see the statistics moving towards their goals and it encourages us to help them reach their goals.  

**what it does:** This landing page will be connected to the AT&T fiber and 5G website. The first part of the website is a live chart that shows the live statistics of At&T's 5G and fiber usage. People can see the pie moving towards the goal and can see when their usage impacts the statistics. The second part of the website is the Atty games. The purpose of the game is to collect fiber points so that you can potentially win discounts for your AT&T plan. Because AT&T fiber and 5G is so fast and efficent, these games are meant to be played super quickly. Everyday, there will be new challenges. You can choose from a few different categories of challenges. When you complete a challenge under the time, you will earn 1 coin. If you are a top player and earn the fatest time, you have the opporutnity of winning 10% off your next AT&T plan. AT&T 5G is faster than the time it takes for you to do these brain teasers. The more you play, the more it will help the copper footprint. 

**how it was built:** It was built on replit using HTML, CSS, and JS. We first designed the prototype on Figma, and then transfered the concepts over. 

**challenges you ran into:** We had many more ideas such as an AI chat bot; however, none of us knew how to code the chat bot. 

**accomplishments you're proud of:** We believe our idea is very unique and can help AT&T. Not that many sites utalize games; and we believe this is a great way to motivate people to use 5G and fiber. 

**what you learned:** We learned alot about AT&T and how 5G and fiber can help so many people across the nation. We also learned to collaborate with another virtually. Our entire team is random and we've never met each other! However, we came together through this hackathon and it was a very fun time. 

**next steps if the project were to continue:** If the project were to continue, we want to implement a chat bot that can answer any questions that customers may ask. We also want to add another game feature. If a device user is not using 5G and their network goes down, a little game pops up. The avator will be rolling a ball shaped like the AT&T logo. The avatar will go through a series of scenes and events until the network works again. Within the game, it will advertise AT&T fiber and 5G. If the user switches their network, they won't run into lagging network again.
